            <p>Conducting customer insurance reviews with your customers will help build the value of your agency over time, but the policy review meeting is only half the process. If you don’t follow up on action items to educate your customer, you’re missing opportunities. The review meetings set the stage, but following up is key to landing the sale. </p>
            <p>If you took proper notes during the customer review meeting and had your customer fill out the needs assessment worksheet, you are armed with valuable information. Here are the steps you need to take immediately after the meeting is complete.</p>
            <p>First, update your customer’s file with any additional information you collected during the review. This could include spouse's name, employment details, or life changes. Also update any changes to their policy that were discussed in the meeting. If you need to increase or decrease their coverage, make sure you take the steps necessary to get that done right away.</p>
            <p>Next, complete any action items or tasks that were requested or came up during the meeting. These could be things like sending the customer a copy of their policy or checking on the status of an open claim.</p>
            <p>From your notes, you will be able to identify educational content to send your customer that relates to their needs and interests.</p>
            
            <h1>One Week After the Meeting</h1>
            <p>One week after your meeting with each customer, give them a call to see if they have reviewed the educational materials you sent with them. Ask them if they have any questions about it. Give them a quote for that specific line of business and give a recap of why they would be interested in it. This is where new policies will naturally be sold. </p>
            <p>Also let them know about your referral program.</p>
            <p>Remind your customers that you will be inviting them back for another appointment in about a year. Say something like “Mrs. Jones, how about I give you a call next September so we can schedule our next appointment to meet again in October”. This way it is not a surprise to your customer when you try to set up another appointment. Remember that consistency is the key to having a successful customer insurance review program. You will need to meet with your customers each year to successfully grow your agency over time.</p>
            <p>I hope this video was helpful in implementing an effective follow up process in order to sell new policies after you meet with your customers. Be sure to check back for more tips and educational content in the future.</p>
