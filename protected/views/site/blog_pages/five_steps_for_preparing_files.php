            <p>Preparation is key when it comes to conducting a customer insurance review meeting. To make your meeting valuable to your customer, don’t just wing it. It will be obvious if you do. Failing to prepare results in a sloppy meeting that is not beneficial for the customer and ultimately begins to weaken the relationship of trust you have built with them. </p>
            <p>The purpose of the meeting is to investigate and educate. Investigate areas where coverage could be improved and educate the client on their needs and how to reduce risk. Getting to know your client and their policies will make you a trusted advisor.</p>
            <p>Here are 5 steps to take to prepare for each customer insurance review meeting you conduct to ensure a valuable experience for your clients.</p>

            <h1>Step 1. Schedule the Appointment</h1>
            <p>The first step of implementing a customer insurance review program for your customers is actually setting some appointments. Setting appointments is the lifeblood of your insurance review program. If you don’t consistently get customers in your office, you will not be maximizing the impact of the program. </p>
            <p>But sometimes scheduling the appointments can be just as hard, if not harder than the actual meeting. Here are a few tips to get you on the right track.</p>
            <p> Agents approach their appointment setting differently, but our recommendation is to work through an A-Z list of your customers. Start with the A’s then the B’s then the C’s all the way down through the Z’s. This will ensure that you systematically work through your entire book of customers without missing anyone. </p>

            <h1>Step 2. Have Your Client Complete a Customer Needs Assessment Form</h1>
            <p>Once you’ve set up an appointment with a customer, send a needs assessment form for them to complete before the meeting. This will help you more efficiently tailor your discussion to their needs and interests. The needs assessment helps your customers recognize areas of potential risk and gets them in the right mindset to discuss policies with you in the review meeting.</p>
            <p>If the client doesn’t fill out the assessment before the meeting for whatever reason, start your meeting by doing it together. The assessment is the <a href="#!">primary tool</a>  to understanding both their short-term and long-term needs. Make notes of any concerns or interests your customer has so you can make sure to bring it up again in the meeting.</p>

            <h1>Step 3. Create a Working File for Each Customer Review</h1>
            <p>While preparing for and actually conducting customer insurance reviews, you will be handling a lot of information. You’ll need to keep track of the customer needs assessment, the customer insurance review worksheet, follow-up information, and any other notes you may take along the way. </p>
            <p>You probably have a client relationship manager or digital database of some kind, but it is a good idea to create a working file for each customer review appointment you have. This way you can keep track of where the customer is at in their life and what your recent recommendations have been. Then when the customer comes in for their next review in a year or so, you’ll be able to circle back to what you reviewed last time. </p>

            <h1>Step 4. Note Current Coverages and Potential Concerns in the File </h1>
            <p>First, become familiar with the coverage amounts and refer to the needs assessment form to determine if this coverage is sufficient for your customer or if you need to make it a point of discussion in your meeting. Ensure that you are prepared to bring up other types of insurance that they may not have with you, but could benefit from.</p>
            <p>Next, make a note of expiration dates in your system so you can be sure to renew policies when necessary.</p>
            <p>Also review any recent claims your customer may have had. Be prepared to discuss them and their implications in your meeting. This will show that you are actively focused on your client and really reinforce the value you provide.</p>
            <p>Review any recent changes to their policies. </p>
            <p>Take note of any personal information you might be missing. You can collect this information in the meeting. You might have to ask the client directly, or you might be able to gather a lot of the information during pleasantries. Information like spouse or children’s names or employer information might come up naturally in conversation.</p>

            <h1>Step 5. Make a Reminder Call</h1>
            <p>Sometimes people just forget about their appointments and no-shows are frustrating. This problem is more common when you first start a customer insurance review program. Once you’ve met with your customers several times, they become familiar with the meetings and your no-show rate improves. Making a reminder call has been helpful for many agents to reduce no-show rates. Call 3 days before the appointment and review your expectations. What is the purpose of the meeting? What does your client need to bring? </p>
            <p>You can also make another call, email, or text the day before or the morning of the appointment to make sure it doesn’t slip your customer’s mind.</p>
            <p>If you follow these 5 steps to prepare for your customer insurance review meetings, you will have a productive, successful meeting. Good luck in your efforts to improve your agency.</p>
