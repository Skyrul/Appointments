                    As a small business, resources can be stretched.  As an agent you know the value of meeting regularly with your customers.  But finding time to schedule these importing meetings can feel near impossible.  That’s where Engagex can help.  Engagex acts like an extension to your office, putting in the time and effort needed to keep a constant flow of appointments coming through the door.  Often, small offices are those that can benefit the most, because Engagex service cost less than additional office staff and you don’t need to find room for a new desk.  All of which leaves you free to do what you do best, selling insurance.

                    The appointments that Engagex will schedule for you are for your current policy holders.  Most carriers or CRMs offer high propensity list that you can choose from.    Some of the most popular list are Auto no Home or High Life Propensity.  
                    <br><br>
                    Other agents choose to make sure that every customer has the opportunity to meet with them and thus go through their business alphabetically.  Following this method can prove especially helpful in creating a record of calls to protect you against E and O claims.

                    We know that despite ours or your best effort, some customers will not show up for their appointments.  That is why Engagex has put together a generous no-show policy to help you.  
                    <br><br>
                    Any appointment that is missed by the customer can be rescheduled.  Simple notify us on your Engagex calendar that the appointment did not show up and we will attempt to reschedule them for a new appointment.  There is no limit to the number reschedules that you can request.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are on a guaranteed appointment package, we will replace up three appointment who don’t show up.  All you need to do is let us know within 48 hours of the scheduled appointment time.  We will first attempt to reschedule that same customer, but we if we are unsuccessful then we will replace the appointment with a new customer.

                    At Engagex we hire an entire team to make calls on your behalf, which helps you avoid the frustrations around having a single caller.  Single callers might be sick, on vacation, have limited schedules or not connect well to your customers.  The team approach used by Engagex helps you to avoid these challenges.
                    <br><br>
                    Most of our callers are students at one of the two nearby universities.  This means we have access to lots of bright and articulate callers who are energetic and happy to be speaking with your customers.  Each of them is trained to make these specific calls with the goal of creating positive interactions on your behalf, even if they don’t schedule an appointment.

                    Engagex makes millions of policy review appointment calls each year and through that experience has developed a script that works well.

                <p class="faqs-list-subtext" >
                    To guarantee the number of appointments that we will set for you we will need enough names, sufficient availability on your calendar and plenty time to set your appointments.  Specifically, this means:<br>
                    <b>Names:</b> You will need to ensure we have 10 times the number of names for each guaranteed appointment.  For example, if you have 10 guaranteed appointments then you will need to make sure we have 100 names each month.  On average, we only need 4 – 6 of those names to schedule the appointment, so unused names can be used in the following month.<br>
                    <b>Availability:</b> You must provide us with available times equal to the number of guaranteed appointments each month.  This means that for us to guarantee 20 appointments you will need to provide no less than 20 available appointment times on your calendar.  Customers really appreciate having more options for meeting times.  It is also a good idea to have one day a week where you are open later to accommodate those that can not make it during regular business hours<br>
                    <b>Timing</b>: Names need to be sent to use no later than the 10th of the month.  This will give us the required time to contact your customers and get them scheduled.
